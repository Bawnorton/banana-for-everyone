<h2>Issues</h2> 
<p>
Issues will not be open on this project and PRs will not be merged unless they are of exceptional quality. I have rarely
if ever seen an issue opened that doesn't describe a bug I'm already patching, so be content with the knowledge that bugs
will be fixed as soon as they are caught. Or you could always fix it yourself and fork it :3
