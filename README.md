Archiving this because I'm unlikely to work on it in any serious capacity. It was good while it lasted.

<h1 align="center">Banana+</h1>

<p align="center">Based addon for Meteor Client.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Formerly maintained by RickyTheRacc</i></p>

## How to Use:
- Download and open with GitHub Desktop
- Open the project through IntelliJ
- Run the gradle `build` task and wait
- Use the jar from the `build/libs` folder

*You can also find automatically built jars in the releases tab after every commit!*

## End of Life
After almost a year and a half of updates, Banana+ has finally reached the end of active development. The addon will be kept available for the latest dev build while Ricky reaches out to AntiCope about giving them the code, but there will be no future updates to the client itself.

## Personal Note From Ben:
This started off as a passion project just for me and Necro, and I think itâ€™s insane how far this actually went. From a meteor prefix to a skid to finally a masterpiece. Thank you all for supporting this project, shits unreal! Sad that this shit happened tho.

B+ on top, All love <3 -ben
