<h2>Issues and PRs</h2> 
<p>
Issues are not open on this project and PRs are unlikely to be merged unless they are of exceptional quality.
Part of the appeal of this project for me is that it's something I can put on a resume, so I want as much of 
the work as possible here to be my own. If you know me personally, feel free to reach out with any issues or 
suggestions you may have though!
